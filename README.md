# About Me
- Alicia Burke amburke2@my.waketech.edu
- This account was made for my classwork in CTI-110 but I think it will be helpful in my other classes as well.
- I am a Programming student at Wake Tech Community College and work full time for Advance Auto Parts as a Store Support Operator. When I am not in school or working I enjoy spending time with my cat, learning on my own, and spending time doing my hobbies. 
## My Interests
My interests include watching tv and movies, completeing puzzles, listening to podcasts, playing video, board, and table top games, assembling and painting models, reading, cooking, and travel. 
## Websites I reccomend
- IMDB (https://www.imdb.com/): IMDB is a great source to find other movies and shows your favorite actors have been in, read synopses of movies and tv shows, and find out who the cast was for a movie or show.
- CodeCademy (https://www.codecademy.com/): CodeCademy is a great resource to begin learning programming, receive further explainations and training, and practice programming.
